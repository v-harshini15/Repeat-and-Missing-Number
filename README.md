The given code finds the repeated and missing numbers in a sequence of integers from 1 to n (where n is the length of the array). It uses the XOR technique to efficiently determine these numbers without using extra memory. Here's a brief explanation:

Calculate the XOR of all numbers from 1 to n (xor_all) and the XOR of all numbers in the array (xor_nums).
XOR these two results to obtain the XOR of the missing and repeated numbers (xor_missing_repeated).
Find the rightmost set bit in xor_missing_repeated to separate the numbers into two groups.
XOR the numbers in each group to find the missing and repeated numbers.
Compare the numbers with the array to determine which one is repeated and which one is missing.
Return the result as a list [repeated, missing].
In the example with input_nums = [3, 1, 2, 5, 3], the output is [3, 4], indicating that 3 is the repeated number, and 4 is the missing number.
